## Simple Discord Bot Example with the Discord.NET Framework (C#)

### Why should you try it?

-   Beginner-friendly
-   Easy to understand
-   Helps you read more OOP code (evil, I know xD)
-   Includes code examples of how to make basic REST API calls in C# using the standard `HttpClient` and `System.Text.Json` libraries :)
-   And a **HUGE** reason: **It was written by me, not a perfect AI!**
    -   *I like to train my programming skills by reading code from somebody else, not just AI.*

### Contributions are welcome!

I hope you'll consider opening a pull request and suggesting some changes.

I made this repo to train myself and help others join in too. ^-^

P.S. I hope I will rewrite this README into a more professional one soon.

Thanks :)
